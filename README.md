# LENDOVISÃO

![Title](Screenshots/title.png)

Developed for the 4th [EPIC-WE] cultural game jam in Óbidos, with theme "Legends",.
I was one of the people that were helping out with the more technical aspects of game development, but being surrounded with criativity, I decided to do this game in about a day, honoring the Eurovision sound contest, one of the most european things in existence!
Afterwards, since I needed a game for the May'25 [Game Creator's Club], I decided to add an extra character to fit with the theme: "Plant".

## Game

This is a rhythm game in which you have to finish you performance to score points.
As usual in this sort of thing, you have to match the cursor keys (or WASD, ifyou prefer) to the notes being played.
The songs are in portuguese, and each of them cover a specific myth in the Portuguese folklore.
